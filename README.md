This portfolio project was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I have tried to create a dynamic and responsive design. It was primarily designed for desktop.

So far it has quite a minimalistic design.
The body is supposed to be a large open sea and the navbar the sky with clouds. My plan is to add animated objects moving around on the scene, for example the moving cloud object and maybe a boat or two.

The HTML is largely created dynamically with Javascript when pressing the navigation buttons to get a snappy and dynamic feel.
I also animate the switching of content between the different navigation buttons.

Flexboxes are used pretty much everywhere.

When scaling down the viewport I have tried to fit the objects better on screen and taken away some elements to fit all the navigation buttons(still work in progress to make it perfect).

I have also added a weather API that fetches the weather in Stockholm(should probably be changed to fetch the local weather for the user) from weatherapi.com.
